<br>
I'm a postdoctoral research fellow of the [Volkswagen
Foundation](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/en.html) at
Universit√§t Heidelberg's [Center for American
Studies](http://www.hca.uni-heidelberg.de/index_en.html).

I earned my PhD in English from
[Washington University in St. Louis](https://twitter.com/wustl), specializing in 19C U.S.
literature. I'm finishing a first book on abolitionist writers'
reclamation of Puritanism and starting a second on the [Melville
Revival](https://www.thenation.com/article/week-nation-history-how-we-helped-start-melville-revival-1920s/).

Both projects involve large archives, so I sometimes use digital tools
to find broader patterns for literary and historical analysis. As a DH fellow at
Wash U, I helped faculty do similar work on 19C
[German](https://hdw.artsci.wustl.edu/projects/articles/34) and
[U.S.](https://hdw.artsci.wustl.edu/projects/articles/37)
novels (topic modeling, translation comparison, etc). I'm also building a digital edition of William Lloyd Garrison's
[*The
Liberator*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberator_(anti-slavery_newspaper)).

I've taught at WUSTL and [Deep
Springs](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2006/09/04/the-searchers-2),
where I learned to lasso. I write criticism and essays in my free time, or ride my
[Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Enfield_Bullet). Testtesttest.
